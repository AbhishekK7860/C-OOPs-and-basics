//There are two types of header files in C++:
// 1. System Header Files: These are the header files that come with the compiler.
#include <iostream> // this is a header file and its system header file
// 2. User-defined Header Files: These are the header files that we create.
// here user defined header file can be like #include "myheader.h"
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout<<"Hello World ";
    return 0;
}
// for more header files you can refer to the C++ documentation or online resources. like cpp reference on google
