Inheritance:

1.Its Reusable And Reusability is a very important feature of Oops

2.In C++ we can reuse a class add additional features to It

3.Reusing classes saves time and money

4.Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing
and debugging the same thing again.

What is inheritance?

1.The concept of Reusability in c++ is supported using inheritance

2. We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from It

3.The existing class is called base class

4.The new class which is inherited is called as the derived class

5.Reusing classes saves time and money

5.There are different types of inheritance in c++

Types of inheritance:

1.single inheritance: A derived class with only 1 base class
Ex:             A class
                   "  |
                   |  |-->Derives
Is Derived from<-- |  |
                   |  "
                B class

2.Multiple Inheritance: A derived class with more than one Base class
Ex:
       Class A and Class B
               to
               Class c

3.Hierarchical inheritance: Several derived classes from a single base class
Ex: 
        Class C
          to
    Class A and Class B

4.Multilevel Inheritance: Deriving a class from already derived class
Ex:
        Class A 
          to
        Class B 
          to
        Class C 

5.Hybrid Inheritance: *Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

*A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.

*However, One of the parent classes is not a base class.
Ex:
        Class A 
          to
   Class B and Class C
          to
        Class D
