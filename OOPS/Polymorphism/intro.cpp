    One name and multiple forms.
    Eg. function overloading and operator overloading.
    eg. Virtual functions
    There are two types of polymorphism:
    1. Compile time polymorphism (static binding)
    2. Run time polymorphism (dynamic binding)

    Compile time polymorphism:
    Compile time polymorphism is achieved using:
    1.1 - Function overloading
    1.2 - Operator overloading
    Run time polymorphism:
    Run time polymorphism is achieved using:
    2.1 - Virtual functions
